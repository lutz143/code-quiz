# Coding-Quiz

## Developer: Josh Lutz

## Description

```
This project displays a number of API and DOM-targeting and manipulation techniques. For example, the timed quiz uses the setInterval method and renders a list of questions and answer choices that a user can select. Additionally, we use localStorage to store initials and highscores of previous players.
```
